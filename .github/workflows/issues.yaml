            Thanks for opening this issue! Please make sure to provide the following information to help us reproduce the issue:
              - Complete cloud formation template used by the customers
              - List of Public CFN Resources that are activated in the AWS account with their release version
              - AWS Region where the CFN stack is running
              - The policies and service principals of the IAM role that is used to activate the CFN resource and run the CFN template (if any).
                Note that passing an IAM role to CloudFormation when creating a stack is optional. If you don't supply one, the user permissions are assumed. See the IAM permissions section in the General information guide for more information.
              
            The ticket [${{ steps.create.outputs.jira-ticket-id }}](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/${{ steps.create.outputs.jira-ticket-id }}) was created for internal tracking.
