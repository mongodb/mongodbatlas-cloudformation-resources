Contributing
---------------------------
## Workflow

MongoDB welcomes community contributions! If youâ€™re interested in making a contribution, please follow the steps below before you start writing any code:

1. Reach out by filing an [issue](https://github.com/mongodb/mongodbatlas-cloudformation-resources/issues) to discuss your proposed contribution, be it a bug fix or feature/other improvements.
1. Sign the [contributor's agreement](http://www.mongodb.com/contributor). This will allow us to review and accept contributions.

After the above 2 steps are completed and we've agreed on a path forward:
1. Fork the repository on GitHub
1. Create a branch with a name that briefly describes your submission
1. Add comments around your new code that explain what's happening
1. Commit and push your changes to your branch then submit a pull request against the current release branch, not master.  The naming scheme of the branch is `release-staging-v#.#.#`. Note: There will only be one release branch at a time.  
1. A repo maintainer will review the your pull request, and may either request additional changes or merge the pull request.
