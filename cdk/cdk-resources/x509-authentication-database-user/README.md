# mongodb-atlas-x509authenticationdatabaseuser

> AWS CDK [L1 construct] and data structures for the [AWS CloudFormation Registry] type `MongoDB::Atlas::X509AuthenticationDatabaseUser` v1.0.0.

[L1 construct]: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/constructs.html
[AWS CloudFormation Registry]: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/registry.html

## Description

Generates one X.509 certificate for the specified MongoDB user. Atlas manages the certificate and MongoDB user that belong to one project. To use this resource, the requesting API Key must have the Project Atlas Admin role. This resource doesn't require the API Key to have an Access List.

To get MongoDB Cloud to generate a managed certificate for a database user, set `"x509Type" : "MANAGED"` on the desired MongoDB Database User.

If you are managing your own Certificate Authority (CA) in Self-Managed X.509 mode, you must generate certificates for database users using your own CA.

## Usage

In order to use this library, you will need to activate this AWS CloudFormation Registry type in your account. You can do this via the AWS Management Console or using the [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) using the following command:

```sh
aws cloudformation activate-type \
  --type-name MongoDB::Atlas::X509AuthenticationDatabaseUser \
  --publisher-id bb989456c78c398a858fef18f2ca1bfc1fbba082 \
  --type RESOURCE \
  --execution-role-arn ROLE-ARN
```

Alternatively:

```sh
aws cloudformation activate-type \
  --public-type-arn arn:aws:cloudformation:us-east-1::type/resource/bb989456c78c398a858fef18f2ca1bfc1fbba082/MongoDB-Atlas-X509AuthenticationDatabaseUser \
  --execution-role-arn ROLE-ARN
```

You can find more information about activating this type in the [AWS CloudFormation documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/registry-public.html).
