Enabling regionalized private endpoints introduces the following limitations:\n  - Your applications must use the new connection strings for existing multi-region and global sharded clusters. This might cause downtime.\n  - Your MongoDB Cloud project can't contain replica sets nor can you create new replica sets in this project.\n\n  - You can't disable this setting if you have:\n    - more than one private endpoint in more than one region\n    - more than one private endpoint in one region and one private endpoint in one or more regions.\n\n- Set this value to `false` to disable regionalized private endpoints."
