## MongoDB::Atlas::FederatedSettingsOrgRoleMapping

### Impact
The following components use this resource and are potentially impacted by any changes. They should also be validated to ensure the changes do not cause a regression.
- Federated settings org role mapping L1 CDK constructor


### Resources (and parameters for local tests) needed to manually QA:
These Atlas federated setting ID must be manually created.
- Atlas Organization (MONGODB_ATLAS_ORG_ID)
- Atlas federated settings id (ATLAS_FEDERATED_SETTINGS_ID)
- Atlas Project (created by cfn-test-create-inputs.sh)


## Manual QA:

### Prerequisite steps:
1. Create an Atlas Organization if you don’t already have one and get the OrgId from URL (https://cloud.mongodb.com/v2#/org/<MONGODB_ATLAS_ORG_ID>/projects)
2. Go to your organization settings and click on “Visit Federation Management App” under “Manage Federation Settings”
3. Note the federationSettingsId from the URL (https://cloud.mongodb.com/v2#/federation/<ATLAS_FEDERATED_SETTINGS_ID>/overview).
4. Configure your federation by configuring domains and Identity Providers.
5. Export MONGODB_ATLAS_ORG_ID and ATLAS_FEDERATED_SETTINGS_ID environment variables.

### Steps to test:
1. Ensure prerequisites above for this resource and general [prerequisites](../../../TESTING.md#prerequisites) are complete.
2. Follow [general steps](../../../TESTING.md#steps) to test a CFN resource.
3. Use this URL to view RoleMappings configured for your organization: https://cloud.mongodb.com/v2#/federation/<ATLAS_FEDERATED_SETTINGS_ID>/organizations/<MONGODB_ATLAS_ORG_ID>/roleMappings

### Success criteria when testing the resource
1. Role mappings should be correctly configured for the Organization under Federation settings:

2. General [CFN resource success criteria](../../../TESTING.md#success-criteria-when-testing-the-resource) should be satisfied.

## Unit Testing Locally

The local tests are integrated with the AWS `sam local` and `cfn invoke` tooling features:

```
sam local start-lambda --skip-pull-image
```
then in another shell:
```bash
repo_root=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)
source <(${repo_root}/quickstart-mongodb-atlas/scripts/export-mongocli-config.py)
cd ${repo_root}/cfn-resources/federated-setting-org-role-mapping
./test/federated-setting-org-role-mapping.create-sample-cfn-request.sh Your Connected OrgID FederationSettingId > test.request.json 
echo "Sample request:"
cat test.request.json
cfn invoke UPDATE test.request.json 
cfn invoke DELETE test.request.json 
```

Both UPDATE & DELETE tests must pass.
