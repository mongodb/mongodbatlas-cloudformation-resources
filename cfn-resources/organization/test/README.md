## Local Testing

The local tests are integrated with the AWS `sam local` and `cfn invoke` tooling features:

```
sam local start-lambda --skip-pull-image
```
then in another shell:
```bash
repo_root=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)
source <(${repo_root}/quickstart-mongodb-atlas/scripts/export-mongocli-config.py)
cd ${repo_root}/cfn-resources/organization
./test/org.create-sample-cfn-request.sh YourOrgName > org.sample-cfn-request.json
echo "Sample request:"
cat test.request.json
cfn invoke resource CREATE /test/org.sample-cfn-request.json
cfn invoke resource DELETE /test/org.sample-cfn-request.json 
```
Once tested you can clean up by running [org.delete-sample-cfn-request.sh](org.delete-sample-cfn-request.sh)

```
./test/org.delete-sample-cfn-request.sh 
```

Both CREATE & DELETE tests must pass.
