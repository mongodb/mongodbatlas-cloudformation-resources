### Resources (and parameters for local tests) needed to manually QA:
The Atlas organization must be manually provided.
- Atlas Organization (`MONGODB_ATLAS_ORG_ID`)
- Atlas Project (created as part of `cfn-testing-helper.sh`)

## Manual QA:

### Prerequisites
1. Create an Atlas Organization if you donâ€™t already have one.
2. Export environment variable `MONGODB_ATLAS_ORG_ID` with the value as your Organization Id.
   You can get this ID from your Atlas UI by clicking on your organization and note the Organization ID from the URL
   which should look like this https://cloud.mongodb.com/v2#/org/<MONGODB_ATLAS_ORG_ID>/projects.

### Steps to test:
1. Ensure prerequisites above for this resource and general [prerequisites](/TESTING.md#prerequisites) are complete.
2. Follow [general steps](/TESTING.md#steps) to test a CFN resource.
