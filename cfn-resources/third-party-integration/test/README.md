# MongoDB::Atlas::ThirdPartyIntegration

## Impact 
The following components use this resource and are potentially impacted by any changes. They should also be validated to ensure the changes do not cause a regression.
 - Third-party integration L1 CDK constructor
 - Third-party integration L2 CDK constructor



## Prerequisites 
### Resources needed to manually QA
- Atlas Project
All resources are created as part of `cfn-testing-helper.sh`

## Manual QA
Please follow the steps in [TESTING.md](../../../TESTING.md).


### Success criteria when testing the resource
1. Atlas Project should show correctly configured integration with chosen third-party service, for example Datadog:

## Local Testing

The local tests are integrated with the AWS `sam local` and `cfn invoke` tooling features:

```
sam local start-lambda --skip-pull-image
```
then in another shell:
```bash
cd ${repo_root}/cfn-resources/thirdpartyintegration
./test/thirdpartyintegration.create-sample-cfn-request.sh > test.request.json 
echo "Sample request:"
cat test.request.json
cfn invoke CREATE test.request.json 
cfn invoke DELETE test.request.json 
```

Both CREATE & DELETE tests must pass.
