## MongoDB::Atlas::X509AuthenticationDatabaseUser

### Impact
The following components use this resource and are potentially impacted by any changes. They should also be validated to ensure the changes do not cause a regression.
- X509 authentication database user L1 CDK constructor




### Resources (and parameters for local tests) needed to manually QA:
CustomerX509 is to be manually provided.
- Atlas project (created by cfn-test-create-inputs.sh)
- CustomerX509



## Manual QA:

### Prerequisite steps:
1. Create a test certificate: One of the ways to create a test certificate is to install OpenSSL and run the following command (source):
```
openssl req -new -newkey rsa:1024 -days 365 -nodes -x509 -keyout test.key -out test.cert
```
A certificate for you will be generated in test.cert file.

2. Use cert from #1 and update cert in inputs/inputs_1_create.json before running cfn test and when creating the stack in AWS CloudFormation in the steps below.


### Steps to test:
1. Follow general [prerequisites](../../../TESTING.md.md#prerequisites) for testing CFN resources.
2. Follow [general steps](../../../TESTING.md.md#steps) to test CFN resources.

### Success criteria when testing the resource
1. X.509 Authentication should be enabled correctly set up in your Atlas Project as per configuration specified in the inputs/example. This can be found under Security section -> Advanced:
