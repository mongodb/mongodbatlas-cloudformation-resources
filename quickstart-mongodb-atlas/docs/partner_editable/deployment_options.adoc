This Quick Start provides three deployment options:

* *Deploy {partner-product-short-name} without VPC peering*. This option peers {partner-product-short-name} with your existing VPC.

* *Deploy {partner-product-short-name} with VPC peering into a new VPC (end-to-end deployment)*. This option builds a complete MongoDB Atlas environment within AWS consisting of a project, cluster, and more.

* *Deploy {partner-product-short-name} with VPC peering into an existing VPC*. This option peers {partner-product-short-name} with a new VPC.


For greater security, each option provisions an AWS IAM role and corresponding MongoDB database user. This Quick Start provides separate templates for these options. It also lets you configure database cluster tier settings and other {partner-product-short-name} settings, as discussed later in this guide.
