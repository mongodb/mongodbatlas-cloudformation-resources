== FAQ

*Q.* I encountered a *CREATE_FAILED* error when I launched the Quick Start.

*A.* If AWS CloudFormation fails to create the stack, we recommend that you relaunch the template with *Rollback on failure* set to *Disabled*. (This setting is under *Advanced* in the AWS CloudFormation console, *Options* page.) With this setting, the stack’s state is retained, and the instance remains running so you can troubleshoot the issue. (For Windows, look at the log files in `%ProgramFiles%\Amazon\EC2ConfigService` and `C:\cfn\log`.)
// If you’re deploying on Linux instances, provide the location for log files on Linux, or omit this sentence.

WARNING: When you set *Rollback on failure* to *Disabled*, you continue to incur AWS charges for the stack. Ensure that you delete the stack when you finish troubleshooting. For more information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/troubleshooting.html[Troubleshooting AWS CloudFormation^].

*Q.* I encountered a size limitation error when I deployed the AWS CloudFormation templates.

*A.* We recommend that you launch the Quick Start templates from the links in this guide or from another S3 bucket. If you deploy the templates from a local copy on your computer or from a location other than an S3 bucket, you might encounter template size limitations. For more information, see http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cloudformation-limits.html[AWS CloudFormation quotas^].

*Q.* Do I need to run the *RegisterMongoDBResource* step each time?

*A.* No. You must run this step only once per Region.

*Q.* What does the *RegisterMongoDBResource* step do?

*A.* It registers each of the MongoDB Atlas CloudFormation resource types. This is a standard requirement for CloudFormation. For more information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/template-custom-resources.html[Custom resource^].

== Troubleshooting

Errors can typlically be resolved by inspecting the CloudFormation event logs or CloudWatch logs created by the MongoDB Atlas CloudFormation resources.

If a stack fails to deploy, check the *Events* tab. If the error occurs for one of the MongoDB Atlas resources (for example, MongoDB::Atlas::Cluster), you will find a corresponding Amazon CloudWatch Logs group called *mongodb-atlas-cluster-logs*. Locate this group, and check the latest log entry to identify the issue.
