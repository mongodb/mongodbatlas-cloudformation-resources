Use this Quick Start to launch a fully managed {partner-product-short-name} deployment on the AWS Cloud.

{partner-product-short-name} is a global cloud document database service for modern applications. Deploying a fully managed MongoDB helps to ensure availability, scalability, and security compliance. You can extend your data with the MongoDB cloud platform, including full-text search, mobile sync, and automated data tiering.

This Quick Start is for developers and DevOps professionals who want to create flexible, fully managed clusters on {partner-product-short-name}. The template creates an Atlas project with a standard, single-region M10 cluster and can be customized for different cluster configurations and project settings.

By default, every {partner-product-short-name} cluster includes the following:

* Support for the latest MongoDB enterprise database versions
* A three-node (minimally) replica set for high availability, deployed into a new VPC
* Built-in security defaults, including always-on authentication and end-to-end encryption
* Fully managed database lifecycle with automated patches, backups, and monitoring
* Performance optimization features such as automatic scaling, index suggestions, and intelligent data tiering
