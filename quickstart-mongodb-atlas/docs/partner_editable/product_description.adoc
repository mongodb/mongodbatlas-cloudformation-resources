Use this Quick Start to automatically set up the following {partner-product-short-name} environment on AWS:

* A {partner-product-short-name} cluster consisting of a minimum three-node replica set, distributed across Availability Zones in the AWS Region of your choice, in a new virtual private cloud (VPC).

* A {partner-product-short-name} project with an optional VPC network peering connection to a new or existing VPC on AWS to allow outbound internet connectivity to your Atlas cluster.

* An AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) instance role with resource-level permissions for access to AWS services and {partner-product-short-name}.

* A MongoDB database IAM role with read and write access to the {partner-product-short-name} cluster in addition to a {partner-product-short-name} IP access list entry for the database user to restrict access to authenticated users.
